/**
 * Naming, colouring and grouping the tab strip.
 *
 * All of this is about telling one tab from another once there are more of them
 * than fit comfortably: eight sessions on the same fleet are eight tabs reading
 * `prod-web-*`, and the strip stops identifying anything. A name you chose, a
 * colour, and an outline around the ones that belong together are the three
 * answers, in ascending order of how many tabs you have.
 *
 * Groups hold *consecutive* tabs only. A group drawn around tabs with other
 * tabs in between would either have to reorder the strip behind the user's back
 * on every render, or draw an outline with holes in it. So joining a group moves
 * the tab to the end of that group instead, which is a move the user asked for
 * and can see.

/**
 * Which of several sessions on the same host each one is.
 *
 * Four terminals on `web-01` are four tabs reading `web-01`. Each gets an
 * ordinal so the tab strip and the pane header can tell them apart: the first
 * `web-01` is 1, the next is 2, counted the way you read the window, left to
 * right along the strip and top to bottom within a split.
 *
 * A host with one session open gets nothing back. Numbering something that is
 * already the only one of its kind is noise, and sameness is the whole problem
 * being solved here.
 *
 * Positional, so closing the first of three renumbers the two behind it. That
 * is the honest reading of "the second web-01": the second one you can see, not
 * the second one ever opened. Numbers that outlived their neighbours would
 * drift into a strip of two tabs labelled 3 and 7.
 *
 * `entries` are `{ id, key }` in that reading order, `key` being whatever
 * counts as the same host. Returns a Map of id to ordinal holding only the ids
 * that need one, so a caller can ask for any id and get `undefined` for the
 * ones that should stay unnumbered.
