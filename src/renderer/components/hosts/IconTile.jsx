/**
 * The badge a card's icon sits in.
 *
 * A square with a heavily rounded corner, echoing the card's own. Distro logos
 * arrive as PNGs at different aspect ratios, weights and amounts of padding, so
 * dropping them straight onto the card left every row a slightly different
 * shape; the tile gives them one silhouette to share.
 *
 * `relative`, because the connection dot hangs off its corner.
