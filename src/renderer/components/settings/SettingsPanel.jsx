/**
 * The two widths this page changes shape at, measured on the panel itself: the
 * assistant opens as a column beside it and takes 340px or more off it, so how
 * much room settings has is not a question about the size of the display.
 *
 * A page is a 160px category list, a 24px gutter, then cards whose rows put a
 * label on the left and a control on the right. The controls are the fixed part
 * (a slider is 320px, a segmented control not much less), so everything a row
 * loses comes out of the label, and the label is the part that has to be read.
 *
 * Under 780 the category list drops to a rail of icons, which is 124px handed
 * straight to the cards, and the rows stay side by side.
 *
 * Under 660 there is no width left to hand over: the rows stack instead, label
 * on one line and control under it, and the cards take their padding in a
 * little. Nothing is hidden and nothing is truncated, the page just gets taller.
