/**
 * The screen a session shows while it is coming up.
 *
 * Lifted out of TerminalView so the desktop views can show the same thing.
 * A shell and a desktop take about as long to open and are waited on the same
 * way, so there was no reason for one of them to answer with a badge breathing
 * halos and the other with a static icon and a full stop.
 *
 * Every colour here is `currentColor`, so this takes on whatever it is dropped
 * into: the terminal's own theme in a shell pane, the app surface in a desktop
 * one. The caller owns the positioning and the background — `className` and
 * `style` land on the outer element — and everything below is the contents.
