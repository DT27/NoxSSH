/**
 * The release state, read by the bell in the title bar and by the About page.
 *
 * Both are mounted at once and both want the same answer, so both subscribe to
 * the same push from main rather than polling: pressing "Check for updates" in
 * Settings has to clear or light up a dot in a title bar that never asked, and
 * a download nobody started has to reach both without either having asked.
 *
 * `null` means "not read yet" and is distinct from a status saying there is no
 * update, which is what stops the button flashing "Up to date" on first paint.
 *
 * `status.mode` is the thing every caller has to read before wording anything.
 * In `install` an update is fetched and applied by a restart; in `notify` the
 * app can only point at a file in a browser. Labelling the second like the
 * first would promise an install that never happens.
