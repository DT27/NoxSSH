/**
 * Slide cards between their old and new positions whenever the order changes.
 *
 * First, Last, Invert, Play: by the time a layout effect runs the browser has
 * already put every card in its new place, so each one is offset back to where
 * it was and then animated to zero. React is not involved in the movement at
 * all: a reorder costs one measure pass and a compositor-only transform per
 * card, which is what keeps it smooth with a folder full of them. The tween
 * itself is GSAP's, from `lib/cardMotion`, as the tab strip's is.
 *
 * Positions are held relative to the container's scrolled content rather than
 * the viewport. Measured against the viewport, scrolling the list would read as
 * every card having moved at once, and the whole grid would animate.
 *
 * `resetKey` is for changes that are not reorders: switching between the grid
 * and the list moves everything, and animating between two entirely different
 * layouts looks like a fault rather than a transition. When it changes the pass
 * only records positions.
 *
 * ## Reflow
 *
 * A grid that takes its column count from its own width rewraps when the
 * sidebar is opened or the window is resized, and none of that goes through React: no state
 * changes, so no layout effect runs, so the cards used to jump between layouts
 * with nothing in between. A ResizeObserver covers that case.
 *
 * It animates on the column count changing, not on the width changing. Between
 * two wraps the cards are only stretching, which is already continuous and
 * needs no help; animating that would put a 220ms tail on every frame of a drag
 * and turn a smooth resize into something rubbery. Every observation still
 * records positions, so the frame before a wrap is the one a wrap animates
 * from.
