/**
 * The Kimi Code provider.
 *
 * Two ways in, in this order, which is the arrangement the Grok provider
 * already uses.
 *
 * Kimi Code CLI is Moonshot's terminal agent. When it is on the machine this
 * drives it one headless run per turn: `kimi -p <prompt> --output-format
 * stream-json`, our own tools served over loopback by `mcp-host` and reached by
 * URL. The agent brings its own harness with it, which is the point of driving
 * an agent rather than a model.
 *
 * When it is not installed, a Moonshot key is enough. `openai-compatible.js`
 * runs the loop instead and talks to api.moonshot.ai, which speaks the same
 * shape as every other server that file was written for.
 *
 * Unlike the other agent cards, both of those paths need a key, and that is
 * worth explaining rather than leaving as a surprise. Kimi Code CLI takes all
 * of its configuration from one user-level directory, `KIMI_CODE_HOME`. There
 * is no flag for an MCP server, no flag for a tool denylist, and no
 * project-level config file: the CLI reads a project's `.kimi-code/mcp.json`
 * only once that folder has been trusted, and trusting one is a keypress in the
 * TUI that a headless run never gets to make. So the only way to hand this
 * agent our tools without editing the user's own `~/.kimi-code` is to point
 * `KIMI_CODE_HOME` at a directory of ours, and a directory of ours does not
 * have their login in it. `KIMI_MODEL_*` is how the key gets in, that being the
 * one channel Kimi Code documents as reading the environment rather than a
 * file, so nothing here writes a credential to disk.
 *
 * What the CLI still buys over the API path is its own agent loop: its context
 * compaction, its skills, its subagents. That is the same reason the other
 * agent cards exist.
