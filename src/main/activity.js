 * connected to what, and who changed what. "Who" is the OS account the app ran
 * under, plus the machine name; this client has no accounts of its own, so
 * that is the only honest answer available, and it is the useful one when a
 * backup travels between machines or two people share a workstation.
 *
 * Nothing secret is recorded. Call sites pass names, addresses, usernames and
 * paths; passwords, key material and passphrases never reach this module, and
 * an edit to one is written as the fact that it changed, never its value. The
 * file is plain JSON, readable by anyone who can read the userData directory,
